    <p><em>This is an archived copy of the Twelve-Factor App methodology, created by Adam Wiggins and the Heroku team.</em></p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use declarative formats for setup automation</li>
        <li>Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system</li>
        <li>Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms</li>
        <li>Minimize divergence between development and production</li>
        <li>Can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Twelve Factors</h2>
    
    <h3>I. Codebase</h3>
    <p>One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys</p>
    
    <h3>II. Dependencies</h3>
    <p>Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies</p>
    
    <h3>III. Config</h3>
    <p>Store config in the environment</p>
    
    <h3>IV. Backing Services</h3>
    <p>Treat backing services as attached resources</p>
    
    <h3>V. Build, Release, Run</h3>
    <p>Strictly separate build and run stages</p>
    
    <h3>VI. Processes</h3>
    <p>Execute the app as one or more stateless processes</p>
    
    <h3>VII. Port Binding</h3>
    <p>Export services via port binding</p>
    
    <h3>VIII. Concurrency</h3>
    <p>Scale out via the process model</p>
    
    <h3>IX. Disposability</h3>
    <p>Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown</p>
    
    <h3>X. Dev/Prod Parity</h3>
    <p>Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible</p>
    
    <h3>XI. Logs</h3>
    <p>Treat logs as event streams</p>
    
    <h3>XII. Admin Processes</h3>
    <p>Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes</p>
