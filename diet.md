**Weight Loss and Fitness Plan**
=====================================

**Goal:** Reach an ideal weight of 190 pounds while focusing on overall health and fitness.

**Timeline:** Aim to lose 1-2 pounds per week, which is a sustainable and healthy rate.

**Diet:**

* **Caloric intake:** Aim for a calorie deficit of 500-750 calories below your maintenance level.

	+ Protein: 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight (around 120 grams of protein per day)
	+ Carbohydrates: 2 grams per kilogram of body weight (around 160 grams of carbs per day)
	+ Fat: 0.5-1 gram per kilogram of body weight (around 40-50 grams of fat per day)
* **Meal frequency and timing:** Aim for:
	+ 4-5 meals per day, including 2-3 main meals and 1-2 snacks
	+ Space out your protein intake every 2-3 hours to keep you feeling full and satisfied

**Exercise:**

	+ Brisk walking (30 minutes, 5 days a week)
	+ Jogging or running (20-30 minutes, 3-4 times a week)
